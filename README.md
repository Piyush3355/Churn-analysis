Project Title: Retail Analytics – Snack Food (Chips) Performance Analysis
Objective:
To analyze chip purchase behavior across customer segments and evaluate the impact of a new store layout aimed at increasing chip sales.

Key Findings:
Sales Trend:

Chip transactions remain steady throughout the year.

A significant spike in chip sales occurs just before Christmas, suggesting a promotional opportunity.

Customer Segments:

Mainstream Young Singles & Couples are the largest chip-buying group.

Young and Older Families make up 26% of chip shoppers and purchase more units per transaction — indicating higher potential sales value.

Affluence Impact:

All affluence levels (Budget, Mainstream, Premium) show consistent purchase behaviors.

Families (young and older) have the highest average units per transaction, regardless of income level.

Experimental Design:
A trial store was selected and a new layout implemented to boost chip sales.

A control store was constructed to reflect the same historical performance of the trial store for comparison.

Results:
Post-layout changes, the trial store outperformed the control store in sales and customer numbers.

The improvement was most visible from February to May, indicating the new layout’s success.

Conclusion:
Promotional strategies like displays or gondola ends around key times (like Christmas), combined with store layout changes, can effectively increase chip sales, especially by targeting family shoppers and mainstream singles.
